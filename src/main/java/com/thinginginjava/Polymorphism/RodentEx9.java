/* 创建Roden（锯齿动物）：Mouse(老鼠)，Gerbil(沙鼠)，Hamster(仓鼠)，等等这样一个继承层次结构。
 * Create an inheritance hierarchy of Rodent:Mouse, Gerbil, Hamster, etc. In the
* base class, provide methods that are common to all Rodents, and override these
* in the derived classes to perform different behaviors depending on the
* specific type of Rodent. Create an array of Rodent, fill it with different
* specific types of Rodents, and call your base-class methods to see what 
* happens.
